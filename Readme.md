This project is an advanced Context-Aware AI Butler, designed to intelligently understand a user’s environment, anticipate their needs, and automate daily tasks across devices. Unlike traditional AI systems that only respond after a user gives a direct command, this system focuses on prediction, context-awareness, and real-time adaptation. The goal is to build a seamless digital assistant that feels intuitive, proactive, and human-like in its decision-making.

The system continuously collects contextual signals such as noise level, ambient light, device usage patterns, presence detection, and current activity. Using this multi-dimensional data, an integrated AI/ML model processes the information and generates personalized recommendations or actions—like enabling focus mode, adjusting brightness, switching device profiles, suggesting breaks, or controlling connected IoT devices.

The project architecture consists of three main layers:

FastAPI-based AI/ML Service
Handles the intelligence layer—parsing context, running the prediction model, and returning smart action suggestions via REST API.

Node.js/Express Backend
Manages users, devices, context logging, suggestion generation, and acts as a bridge between frontend and AI. The backend ensures scalability, logs activity patterns, and exposes secure REST endpoints.

Interactive Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
Displays real-time system insights, smart suggestions, environment stats, and device states in a clean, responsive, and visually rich UI. The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch predictions and device actions.

This integration results in a system that feels truly “alive”—continuously monitoring context and intelligently adjusting itself without waiting for explicit user instructions. It demonstrates strong concepts like contextual AI, automation, device orchestration, behavior prediction, and human-centric design.

Overall, the AI Butler showcases how intelligent automation can enhance everyday productivity, reduce cognitive load, and deliver a futuristic user experience.
